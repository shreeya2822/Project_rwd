                                PM.Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950. He is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress. PM.Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. A little over 1,000 people were killed, according to official records, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.While his policies as chief minister, which were credited for encouraging economic growth, were praised, Modi's administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment; it reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated the 2016 demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.

                                It is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka, a statue that served as an emblem on the Ashoka Pillars constructed by Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire between 269 and 232 BCE. It is a dimensional sculpture in the shape of four lions, each facing a different direction. At Sarnath, the actual capital, four Asiatic lions are arranged back-to-back, symbolizing power, courage, confidence, and pride, and the entire structure is mounted on a circular base. The bottom of the image has a horse and a bull, while the center contains a Dharma chakra.

Over an abacus with a full blossom of lotus illuminating the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration, there is a frieze of sculptures depicting the Lion of the North, The Horse of the West, The Bull of the South, and the Elephant of the East. This polished stone capital is formed from a single block of sandstone, crowned by a wheel of the law. Below the abacus in Devanagari script is the motto: Satyameva Jayate, which is an integral part of the emblem. Quoted from the Mundaka Upanishad, a sacred Hindu text.
